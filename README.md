# Car-Data-Set-Analysis
This Project will give an idea about the car and its parameters and help the buyer to buy an efficient car.
We will apply different data science techniques to the dataset to remove all the outliers.
 And apply the Random Forest algorithm and linear regression to find the accuracy.
 Analyzing a car dataset typically involves loading the dataset, exploring its contents, and extracting insights. Below is a simplified example in Python using the Pandas library. This example assumes you have a CSV file with car data.
 This code provides a basic overview of how you can analyze a car dataset using Python and Pandas. Depending on the dataset's structure and your analysis goals, you may need to perform more complex analyses, handle missing data, or create visualizations using additional libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.
